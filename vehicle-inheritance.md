## Polymorphism

When our classes start inheriting from other classes, we also have to consider polymorphism. 

Polymorphism is the idea that objects can be treated as if they belonged to any of the classes above them in the inheritance chain. 

We can instantiate objects of a child class and store it in a variable of its parent type, group them together in arrays/lists as the parent type, or use the parent type as a member of an additional class.
