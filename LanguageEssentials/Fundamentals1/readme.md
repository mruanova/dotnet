Create a Loop that prints all values from 1-255 

Create a new loop that prints all values from 1-100 that are divisible by 3 or 5, but not both  

Modify the previous loop to print "Fizz" for multiples of 3, "Buzz" for multiples of 5, and "FizzBuzz" for numbers that are multiples of both 3 and 5 

(Optional) If you used "for" loops for your solution, try doing the same with "while" loops. Vice-versa if you used "while" loops!

EXTRA: Generate a sequence of integers from 1 to 10 and then select their squares.
