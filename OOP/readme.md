## Access Modifiers

C# allows for control over where your class members can be accessed, achieved by using a set of keywords - each with a specific rule regarding that member's accessibility level.  They are:

public: No access restriction

private: Access restricted to own class (default for class members)

protected: Access restricted to own class, and any child class

internal: Access restricted to Assembly (essentially, your project's compiled .dll)
